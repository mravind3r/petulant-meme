created a folder called FileSearcher

cd FileSearcher

inside here created a build.sbt file  which is like th pom.xml of maven , make sure you have the correct version os scala ( shud be same as the one installed) scala --version

next created a folder called project 

cd project

inside project directory created 2 files 

build.properties  -- this file contains the sbt version used to build the project , make sure it is the same as the installed sbt version ( sbt --version)

plugins.sbt  -- here i specify the eclipse plugin



cd Filesearcher


from here run the following command -- > sbt eclipse 
this will download all the jars etc ( it uses ivy)



observe the changes  inside filesearcher folder ( tree  here)



now go to eclipse -- import exsisting projects and naivate to filesearcher and import.



-- tips 

filesearcher > sbt   (enter)

> test - this will run the tests , exactly like maven

>compile will compile the code


to have an interactive system running 

> ~test  makes change sin eclipse ide to code and observe, sbt automatically does everything for you , no need to run -- sbt test  ( like mvn test)


-- any libraries you want to add eg: scala test libs etc go into the build.sbt file inside filesearcher project
